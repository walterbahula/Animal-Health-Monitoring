# Animal-Health-Monitoring System
Animal Health Monitoring using remote sensors


1. Introduction
Animals play a crucial role in various aspects of human life, including agriculture, food production and scientific research. Ensuring their health and well-being is paramount for sustainable farming and food production. Traditional methods of monitoring animal health often lack efficiency and real-time insights. Therefore, there is a growing need for innovative technologies to enhacing animal health monitoring. This project proposes the development of an Animal Health Monitoring System (AHMS) leveraging advancements in sensing technologies, data analytics, and communication systems.

2. Objectives
The primary objective of the proposed AHMS is to provide real-time monitoring and early detection of health issues in animals. Specific goals includes:

    Designing non-invasive sensing system to continuously monitor vital health parameters such as temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, and activity levels.
    Developing intelligent algorithms for data analysis to detect anomalies and patterns indicative of potential health issues.
    Establishing a robust communication framework for seamless data transmission between monitoring devices, data processing units, and user interfaces.
    Integrating the AHMS into existing livestock management systems to provide holistic monitoring and decision support tools for farmers, veterinarians, and researchers.
    Ensuring affordability, scalability, and ease of use.
